# React Hooks Practice – useContext & useReducer

This project is part of my learning journey with **React Hooks**. It includes two small examples to understand and practice `useContext` and `useReducer`.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🔹 1. useContext Example – Styling Boxes
In this example, I created multiple boxes, each with a **"Style Me"** button. When clicked:
- It changes the background color of the **entire page**.
- It also changes the background of the corresponding box.

All styling state is managed globally using **React Context API**.

### 🔹 2. useReducer Example – ToDo List
This is a basic ToDo List application built using `useReducer`. You can:
- Add tasks
- Mark them as complete
- Delete tasks

It helped me understand how state and actions are handled with reducers in React.
